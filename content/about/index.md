Hi, my name is Tobias. I was born in a small village near Rottweil, DE in 1988.
My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German, English, Swedish and French.

In my young years I was a real rowdy. I'm saying this with a certain pride. 
The only thing I was really interested in was computers - mainly for gaming.
School was not very appealing and so I started an apprenticeship with Deutsche Telekom AG.
After finishing this education I started working as a IT consultant for small and medium sized companies.

In my mid twenties I felt a desire to make up for all the unfinished homework.
I decided to get back to school and completed my A levels.
There I discovered the fact that with vision, motivation and perseverance many things are possible.

After graduation I decided to move to Jena, a beautiful city. 
I took up my studies in the subject Business Information Systems.
During my studies I had a one year visit in Borl√§nge, SE.

Right now I am finishing my master thesis and look forward to visit Tallinn, EE for another exchange year.
