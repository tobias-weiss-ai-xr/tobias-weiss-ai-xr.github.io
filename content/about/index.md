Hi, my name is Tobias. I like to play my guitar. When the weather is good, I go
jogging or biking. IT things are also fine :)

I was raised in a small village in south-est Germany. 
My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German and English. 
I also understand Swedish and French.

After graduation I moved to Jena, a beautiful city in Thurighia. 
During my studies I had the opportunity to go on a one year visit in Borl√§nge, Sweden.
It was one of the best parts in my life so far.

Right now I am finishing my master thesis and look forward to visit Tallinn, EE for another exchange year.
