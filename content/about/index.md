Hi, my name is Tobias. I like to play my guitar(s). When the weather is good I go
jogging, biking or do other outdoor activities. When the weather is bad, I work out at home (or at the gym - if it is open).

I was raised in a small village in south-east Germany. 
My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German and English. 
Swedish and French also works to some extend.

IT things are fine as well :). What really hooked me was and still is Linux.
After school and apprenticeship I worked as system administrator.
Nowadays, I am still maintaining some systems but most of the time goes into coding. 
I view back of quiet a history of projects with a broad variety of tool stacks.

A few years ago I decided to work on my formal education and moved to Jena, a beautiful city in Thurighia. During my studies I had the opportunity to go on a one year visit to Borl√§nge, Sweden. It was one of the best parts in my life so far.

Right now I am finishing my master thesis and look forward for a stay in Tallinn, EE to experience another exchange year.
