Hi, my name is Tobias. I was raised in a small village in south-est Germany in 1988.
My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German, English, Swedish and French.

In my young years I was a real rowdy. I'm saying this with certain pride. 
The only thing I was really interested in was computers - mainly for gaming.
School was not very appealing. So I quit as soon as possible and started an apprenticeship with Deutsche Telekom AG.
After finishing this education I started working as an IT consultant for small and medium sized companies.

In my mid twenties I felt a desire to make up for all the unfinished homework.
I decided to get back to school and completed my A levels.
There I discovered the fact that with vision, motivation and perseverance many things are possible.

After graduation I moved to Jena, a beautiful city in Thurighia. 
First I starded with General Informatics, but many subjects appeared pointless to me.
I swaped my studies to the subject Business Information Systems.
The mix between economics and IT suited me way better.

During my studies I had a one year visit in Borl√§nge, SE.
It was one of the best parts in my life so far. 
Besides the language I learned a lot of things and discovered sports as a new personal need.
Today I am a passionate gym visitor, jogger and cyclist. I even own my own kajak.

Right now I am finishing my master thesis and look forward to visit Tallinn, EE for another exchange year.
