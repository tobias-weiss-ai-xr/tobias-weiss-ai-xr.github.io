It is time to retire my old Typo3 website. It was up for over 10 years now.
I still kinda like the old green style. But I want to become a bit more serious as I grew up over this period - at least a little bit.

To keep it in good memories, let me keep a picture:

I replace it with this fancy new hugo blog. I think it is a good tech choice for this kind of website. Hopefully it will also last longer than 10 years.

The first issue can be viewed on this page. Images can not be scaled with markdown syntax. I also do not know how the curly braces syntax works. So as it is fun to learn new things I am curious to dig into it!
