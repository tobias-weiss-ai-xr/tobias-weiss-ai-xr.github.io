After finishing my thesis I deserved some holidays. 
Luckily my friend Peter lived in Dresden at that time.
So, I decided to visit him with my bike and make a two day stop at Leipzig.
In the background, you see the Voelkerschlachtdenkmal, which is remniscent of the battle
between Napoleon and the prussians in the year 1813.

The city is nice and offers a great inner circle to explore.
I can recommend the Naturhistorische Museum as it only costs 1.5 Euros entrance fee. 
The botanical garden is also awesome.

However, after two days I went further to Dresden to meet Peter. We were lucky and had very good weather
during our trip through the Saxonian Schweiz. The route to the first city in Czech Republic called Děčín is about 130 KM return.

Finnaly, we were even more lucky because the yearly museum night took place at exactly
the date when I was in Dresden. We visited many museums for cheap and saw a lot of art
and historical artefacts. I found the armory of the museum called Gruenes Gewoelbe particularly interesting.

In overall a very nice way to calm down after a long period of hard work :)
