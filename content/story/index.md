Hi, my name is Tobias. 

I was raised in a small village in south-west Germany. 
My mother tongue is Swabian. 
However, I am also familiar with German and English. 
Swedish and French also work to some extent.

With respect to Information Technology (IT), most things are fine for me. 
What really hooked me was and still is Linux.
After school and apprenticeship, I worked as a system administrator.
I am still maintaining some systems, but most of my time goes into coding and project management.
Overall, I can look back to quite a history of IT related projects with a broad variety of tool stacks.

A few years ago, I decided to work on my formal education and moved to Jena, a beautiful city in Thurighia.
During my undergraduate Business Information Systems studies I had the opportunity to spend time in Estonia and Sweden.
Scandinavia and the Baltics remain part of me.
I finished my master and found a placement in Giessen, Hesse.

I am interested in eXtended reality (XR), a term that covers all kinds of augmented reality (2D display and headset based) and fully immersive virtual reality.
In my consumer behavior experiments, I combine XR with bio sensors, such as eye tracking and electrocardiography.
My research topic is how to provide adaptive user assistance in the forthcoming virtual commerce domain.
A good timing for help offerings and appearing elements in the user interface are key for such adaptive user assistance.
I am also pursuing in the question how to integrate artificial intelligence piplines into learning and business applications.
