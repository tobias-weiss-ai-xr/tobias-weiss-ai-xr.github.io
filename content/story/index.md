Hi, my name is Tobias. 

I was raised in a small village in south-west Germany. 
My mother tongue is Swabian. 
However, I am also familiar with German and English. 
Swedish and French also work to some extent.

With respect to information technology, most things are fine for me. 
What really hooked me was and still is Linux.
After school and apprenticeship, I worked as a system administrator.
I am still maintaining some systems, but most of my time goes into coding and project management.
Overall, I can look back to quite a history of IT related projects with a broad variety of tool stacks.

A few years ago I decided to work on my formal education and moved to Jena, a beautiful city in Thurighia.
During my undergraduate Business Information Systems studies I had the opportunity to spend time in Estonia and Sweden.
Scandinavia and the Baltics remain part of me.
I finished my master and found a placement in Giessen, Hesse.

Today, I pursue my research interests as part of the [kd2school graduate program](https://www.kd2school.info).
I am interested in mixed reality (XR) which includes all kinds of augmented reality and virtual reality.
In my experiments, I combine XR with bio-sensors such as eye trackers and ECG.
My goal is to provide user assistance in the forthcoming v-commerce domain.
I am also curious about XR in education. See the XR section to see a few works.
