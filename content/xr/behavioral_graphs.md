Behavioral Graphs (BGs) extend [Mozilla Hubs](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) with interactive features.
I think BGs are a great opportunity to push the limits of old "gallery like" secenes.

I happily share the link to the Hubs testing instance:

[Behavoral Graphs Testing Instance](https://testing.dev.myhubs.net/y2JZXuM/authentic-wry-adventure?newLoader&ecsDebug&vr_entry_type=2d_now&entity_state_api&&debugLocalScene)

However, you need to sign up for alpha testing:
