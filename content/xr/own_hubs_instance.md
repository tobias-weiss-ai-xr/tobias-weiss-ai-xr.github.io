I decided to host my own Hubs instance:

Here is what ChatGPT would write about this news:

Mozilla Hubs is a virtual reality (VR) platform developed by Mozilla that enables users to create and join virtual spaces for socializing, collaboration, and immersive experiences.
It allows individuals to interact with each other using customizable avatars in a shared 3D environment.
One unique aspect of Mozilla Hubs is its accessibility; users can join virtual spaces directly from their web browsers without the need for additional plugins or downloads.
Tobias Weiss, an enthusiastic host, has established a virtual space at https://tobias-weiss.org:8888/, showcasing the versatility and ease of use of Mozilla Hubs.
By hosting a hub at this web address, Tobias provides a personalized and engaging environment for participants to connect, communicate, and explore within the virtual realm.
This initiative reflects the growing popularity of virtual collaboration tools and the creative ways individuals are leveraging technology to bring people together in innovative digital spaces.
