    <p>Hi, my name is Tobias. I was raised in a small village in south-est Germany in 1988.
My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German and English.
I also understand Swedish and French.</p>
<p>Since my youth a thing I was really interested in was computers &ndash; both hard and software.
So I decided to get hands on experience as soon as possible and started an apprenticeship with Deutsche Telekom AG.
After finishing this education I started working as an IT consultant for small and medium sized companies.</p>
<p>In my mid twenties I felt a desire to make up for all of my unfinished homework.
Hence, I decided to get back to school and completed my A levels with focus on economics.
I discovered the fact that with vision, motivation and perseverance many things are possible.</p>
<p>After graduation I moved to Jena, a beautiful city in Thurighia.
First I starded with General Informatics, but many courses appeared too theoretical to me.
Fortunately, I was allowed to swap my subject to Business Information Systems which suits my ends much better.
The course offer was a mix of economics and IT.</p>
<p>During my bachelor studies I had the opportunity to go on a one year visit in Borlänge, Sweden.
It was one of the best parts in my life so far.
Besides the language I experienced a lot of culutral aspects and discovered sports as a new personal need.
Today I am a passionate gym visitor, jogger and cyclist. I even own my own kajak.</p>
<p>Right now I am finishing my master thesis and look forward to visit Tallinn, EE for another exchange year.</p>
