      <description>Hi, my name is Tobias. I like to play my guitar(s). If the weather is good, I go jogging, biking or do other outdoor activities. Otherwise, I work out at the gym.
I was raised in a small village in south-west Germany. My mother tongue is Swabian. However, I am also familiar with German and English. Swedish and French also works to some extent.
Most IT things are fine for me.</description>
