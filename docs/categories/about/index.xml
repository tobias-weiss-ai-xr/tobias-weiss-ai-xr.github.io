      <description>Hi, my name is Tobias. I like to play my guitar(s). When the weather is good I go jogging, biking or do other outdoor activities. When the weather is bad, I work out in the gym.
I was raised in a small village in south-west Germany. My mother tongue is Swabian. However, I am also familiar with German and English. Swedish and French also works to some extend.
IT things are fine as well :).</description>
