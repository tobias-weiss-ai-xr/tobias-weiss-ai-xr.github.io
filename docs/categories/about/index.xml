      <description>Hi, my name is Tobias. I was born in a small village near Rottweil, DE in 1988. My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German, English, Swedish and French.
In my young years I was a real rowdy. I&amp;rsquo;m saying this with a certain pride. The only thing I was really interested in was computers - mainly for gaming. School was not very appealing and so I started an apprenticeship with Deutsche Telekom AG.</description>
