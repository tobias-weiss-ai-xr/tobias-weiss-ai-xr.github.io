      <description>Hi, my name is Tobias.
I was raised in a small village in south-west Germany. My mother tongue is Swabian. However, I am also familiar with German and English. Swedish and French also work to some extent.
Most IT things are fine for me. What really hooked me was and still is Linux. After school and apprenticeship, I worked as a system administrator. I am still maintaining some systems but most of my time goes into coding.</description>
