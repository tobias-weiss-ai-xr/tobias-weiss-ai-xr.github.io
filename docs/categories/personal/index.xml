      <description>Hi, my name is Tobias. I like to play my guitar. When the weather is good, I go jogging or biking. IT things are also fine :)
I was raised in a small village in south-est Germany. My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German and English. I also understand Swedish and French.
After graduation I moved to Jena, a beautiful city in Thurighia. During my studies I had the opportunity to go on a one year visit in Borl√§nge, Sweden.</description>
