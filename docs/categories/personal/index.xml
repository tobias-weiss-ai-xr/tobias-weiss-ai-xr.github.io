      <description>Hi, my name is Tobias. I like to play my guitar(s). When the weather is good I go jogging, biking or do other outdoor activities. When the weather is bad, I work out at home (or at the gym - if it is open).
I was raised in a small village in south-east Germany. My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German and English. Swedish and French also works to some extend.</description>
