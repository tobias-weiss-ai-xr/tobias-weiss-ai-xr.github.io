      <description>Hi, my name is Tobias. I was raised in a small village in south-est Germany in 1988. My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German and English. I also understand Swedish and French.
Since my youth a thing I was really interested in was computers &amp;ndash; both hard and software. So I decided to get hands on experience as soon as possible and started an apprenticeship with Deutsche Telekom AG.</description>

      <description>It is time to retire my old Typo3 website. It was up for over 10 years now. I still kinda like the old green style. But I want to become a bit more serious as I grew up over this period - at least a little bit.
Let me take a screenshot to keep the good memories:
  I replace it with this fancy new hugo blog. I think it is a good tech choice for this kind of website.</description>
