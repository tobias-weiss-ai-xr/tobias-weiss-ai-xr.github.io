      <description>Hi, my name is Tobias. I was raised in a small village in south-est Germany in 1988. My mother tongue is Swabian, however I am also pretty familiar with German and English. I also understand Swedish and French.
Since my youth a thing I was really interested in was computers &amp;ndash; both hard and software. So I decided to get hands on experience as soon as possible and started an apprenticeship with Deutsche Telekom AG.</description>
